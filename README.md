Convey is an AI Suite designed for effortless multimedia content creation and management. 
Convey features seven powerful tools that allow users to generate videos from text and images, create video thumbnails, 
and transcribe or summarize content from YouTube, podcasts, PDFs, and audio files.

Google Keyword Planner was used to identify a broad set of relevant search keywords for each of the seven tools of the product. 
Key metrics used in selecting relevant keywords include: keywords showing user intent, keywords with high search volume (500 searches per month or more in the USA),
keywords with manageable competition (Low or Medium).
